** ChitChat Inferences Experiments
For baseline in parlai, you should first load in =DiaSaf_Dataset= and execute =transfer2parlaiformat.py= for formation transfering. Then, go back to the main directory and running =bash parlai_commands.sh= to obtain experiments results.

After that, baseline in parlai or others can be evaluated by running =bash this_repo_path/3.0.running_all_experiments.sh=.

** Neural Metrics Evaluation Experiments

1. transfer the inference results into the target-metric formation. Frist =cd your-saved-inference-result-path=, then running =python transfer2XXX.py= to transfer your file into "XXX".
2. load in the directory of neural metrics you want to use (e.g. /repo_path/neuralmetric/MDD-Eval/infer.sh), and run related scripts, like  =bash infer.sh=.
